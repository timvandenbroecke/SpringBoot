# RaspberryLedFirmata
Using Spring boot + Firmata4J + Arduino Uno + Raspberry pi B. </br>

A simple Spring boot application.</br>
In this very small project you can control the arduino through the Raspberry pi.</br>
And by using Spring boot @RestController to put an Arduino LED on and off really easy.</br>
ps: The Arduino uses the "StandardFirmata" schema you can find it in the Arduino examples schemas.
