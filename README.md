# RaspberryLedFirmata
# SpringBoot + Raspberry pi + Arduino + Firmata4j

A simple Spring boot application.<br/>
In this very small project you can control the arduino through the Raspberry pi.<br/>
And by using Spring boot @RestController to put an Arduino LED on and off really easy.</br>
ps: The Arduino uses the "StandardFirmata" schema you can find in the Arduino example schemas.
